# Snow flake canvas

This project has been inspired by particle.js. I intend to reference it throughout this project.

# The plan

## The canvas:

The canvas will be added via JS, and should fit the div it is in. I will tack on a function to "window" where the user needs to provide a route to the config file as well as the id for the div to use. I will copy particle.js for this... Maybe learn about the window object a bit.

## The particles:
    The config file will have:
        - number of particles
        - an array of routes to svg images (for variety)
        - direction of snowflakes (?)
        - variation on opacity of particles (?)
    I believe I will make a class for the particles

I may use the breakout game I learnt as a starting point to working with canvas.

## The load function:

called "window.letItSnow(div, config file route);
